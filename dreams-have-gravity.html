            I had a nightmare last night.

I woke up,
     shielding myself with thick covers
            my heart racing
            my mind battling
            my eyes darting
                         not wanting to see what I
                                                couldn't
                                                didn't
                                                believed I would see

and in a moment of light
                        I pushed back my covers,
         exposing myself to the darkness
and the coolness

I thought
      the demons make me so childish
      haven't I overcome these fears?
      yet the cold of fears of old still shrouded me
              and I couldn't push it back

My dream
     in fact
wasn't about
        monsters or
        an embarrassment
        or failure

it was about
      myself
                  as not myself
            an uncontrolled possession of my mind
            bizarre actions of the dark
                   the dark
                         that so grips
                                                          silently grips
         our world
                                           sneaking mind to mind
                         with a cold grip
                                                                             slow grips
      and I                                                                          
                                                        slipped
                          in what
                                                 what was that?
                                                 who was that?
                                                 why was I-

I began to cool
       and light on the foolishness
                             and chaoticness
                light came
                             within me
                brought a clarity
                      of what is outside
                              the semi-permeable walls of my mind
            and what is inside
     my now normalizing physical shell

I couldn't help but feel
                                                               frightened.

       This felt like
                                        an intrusion,
                                          an attack,
                     one episode
                     of a constant battle within
                                                                  and without
            that is not finished
                  not finished soon

      This attack
           that occurred with such
           suddenness
                 and surprise
                        a new custom-made spin of sin
                                                                of scares
                        old bones of the battle rattling
                       
      This attack that
            caused me to resist
                   but scarily barely
            I resisted
                   pulling off my sheets
                         unprotecting to protect

I threw back
  slipped grips
    sent back the attack to hold my soul
    warily unwearing
    daring to unattach
    for the blaring
             the snatch
             because I held on
         and trusted
and threw off the mess
     threw off the mess of myself
     become bare
                     barely escaping
             the comforts
             the heating danger
                              the stranger
                        the nightmare stranger
                       of my dream.

            and then

            this uncovering

            became significant.


a flood of realization
a story
a mind-scream

I entered
the first strange reflection:
     my childhood was very bright
     except for the nightmares.
         the momentary darkness
               when reality is traded
                     for realistic fantasies
                         full of fear


A strange dream:
     at my elementary school playground
             the swings vivid
             the slide bright red
                    full of static
                    shockingly unchanged

and then a hole
    black like the future's clarity
between the climbing wall and monkey bars
    I jump in.


                                                                                       And fall down
then up

                                     and land where I
                                          leapt from.


I jumped in again
                                                                                                        and out
                                                  and back
and realized
I'm stuck.

The red slide-
            still static.

there were no kids on the playground
            it was still
there was no wind in the air
            no sensation


The red slide-
            still static.

there were no kids on the playground
            it was still
there was no wind in the air
            it was still
            still

I don't know when I woke up.
        But I must have.


That was a deep dream
                        for a kid.
                                               deeper than that hole.

Strange nightmares.
So long ago.
                                                                                   Distant.
Yet never left.

Dreams faded.
I grew
      grew up
      woke up
back to bed
a day in between.

I would come back to the same place
            each year
   around the twelfth rotation
                 the twelfth year of my thoughts
         a reoccurring REM:

That feeling
                        the startling bounce
as you wake up
and feel like you were falling
                                    and have just landed
in your bed
a cushion of reality

But for me I was falling
because
            for me I was flying

it wasn't easy to fly
   it was a struggle
            I wasn't weightless
                 but had just enough power
                                                       to climb
I wasn't soaring
       but
     I wasn't on the ground
                 and I was gaining altitude

every once in a while
                  I'd slip
            become weary
       drop a few feet
and changing that
                                    downward dip
                        was the hardest trial

It wasn't just the physics
       (and of course-dreams have gravity)
but the trend in the mind
        the message of negative direction
is what drags you down the hardest
                                         and clouds your head
                 but the rushing ground motivates
                        and the struggle struggles upward
and I find my hopes turn up
            when my effort turns up
                    and my self turns up
                                                        to have a purpose.

and that is what I found
            a purpose in the air.
                        that was always there
                                    let efforts dare
                                                and you'll fly.

and life began
            to answer
some of that why.

After purposefulness comes control.
     but when you close your eyes
     where does that control go?

Your mind is at the mercy of your mind
     I find
a deeper mind within the mind
     mind find
cracked gold inside
shining white
faded black
and the attack

is back
            from before
even now
the world reels
            and starts to fade
                        will I wake
                        for heaven's sake
haven't I overcome these fears?

One moment:
            a large rocky precipice
                        precipitating
            crumbling apart
                        avalanche dance
                                    sky above
                                    earth flow

One moment:
     a plane of ice
plain before me
     flat
     slip
     a slide
bright red
red blood
         no control
         where did the control go?
         a monster
              no features
              no form
                  it's just a monster
      and it chases me
          me who has no control
          where do I go
                       but slide

The eyes of those closest to me
            flashing red
where do they go?
             I awake

I flip my pillow
            slam my head
            slam my eyes
            my mind slams
darkness but for a wish
                        I wait

light?

reeling forwards
            sideways
                        over and around
      position question
      preposition place
           the intersection of questions and falling
                   bright and night
can I fly?
should I jump?
how can I run?

it never rains in my nightmares
            but its never dry
                        always somewhere to slip

traction in reality
traction in truth
attraction in reactions
            constant reactions retractions
                        I battle
                        I slide
                        I fly
                                    I fall
                        but in the nightmares
                        I must try
                        I can never die

only wake.

Sometimes my eyes blur
     and mists a dream world
            that appears
                                      I peer
     but reality makes fake-
a stir
                      and so I'm awake
             I sink down
                  a lurch
acceleration
I land
                                      but reality's ground
  is shifting sand

I must remember the real world's appearance
      or I am but a dream's fool
                             who thinks he exists
                 and nothing more
                                 I can't sit but must stand
only then can I leap
                               or give a hand

These people who I live for
                                live by
                                love why?
                    it seems they
            are but shapes
            drifting before my eyes
                     but I am not wanting to be sold
            there's more than I see
                     so I peer
                                        they unfold
                 I see me in them
                          and us in a story
                                   what is our role?
          but it is in the figuring out
               and pushing upward
                                            falling downward
                   our story becomes told
we become bold.

Sometimes it's easiest to see life
        as one long dream                                        [nightmare?]
                a puff of smoke
        amidst the millennia
all our moments compressed in waiting
       depressed in release
            initialized then
            moving moments
                                    drifting
                                                fading
through life, all our lives, each survives
but
            what propels?
                                    something outside?
                                    something within?
            our characters move with purpose
and the drifting
                                                fading
                                                            are lies
              we can go farther than just to survive

connections in the head
      our thoughts
             some bitty atom clouds
                        buzzing with electricity

a puzzle of raining wires                                         
we have bending brains
                                  that contort with latent twists
            but stretched straight, we strive

clouds above
that destination
we fly
clouds within
ask questions
but why?
drifting atoms
              bumpity bump
                    here is the universe
                    here is the sky

far stars
               supernovas
                                  a soul explodes
                                  in the galaxy

a flash of time
the birth of a star
                                                                        the fade of a puff
                                which is our focus?
                        can our focus ever be enough?

I've always asked more questions than answers
I've always looked more than I've found
but I will not settle for drifting
       settling dust
       fading trust
I hold on
          grip to rungs of truth
               and it shakes
               my hands tremble
                        but it is worth the effort
                                              the stand
                        the grip to the constant
                                              by hand
                        the stars
                                              not the sand

They hang in the sky
I hang on
my mind orbits                                 
a truth
                            I bend
the pull of gravity                            
a purpose
                            I mend
     close my eyelids                                           
a passageway
                            I'm sent
            and slip

                                                              a nightmare
                                                              a dream
                                                              a darkness
                                                              a light
                                                              a story

Dreams are unexplainable entities
            watch out
                        you may find
            the core of reality
in something you can't explain

and the fear of trust
            the soul trust

grips the looming nightmares
