<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"[I ask] for those who will believe in me through [my disciples'] word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">John 17:21</p>

<p>Are we, the Church, "one" as Jesus prayed for?<br>
Has this, Jesus' prayer, been answered?<br>
If not, can it be answered before He returns?</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment...</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Corinthians 1:10</p>

<p>Is it really possible for the whole Church to be "united in the same mind" as Paul writes?<br>
Do you believe that all faithful Christians could agree, that there could be no divisions among them?</p>

<p>Over the past year, I have taken time to immerse my thoughts and reading and Biblical study in an explorative journey of these verses and questions, and the result was slowly developing a series of writings titled <i>The Hope of Unity</i>.</p>

<p>The goal in sharing out these things is in fact a greater hope of unity among Christians, hopefully multiplied by each person reading this. That you and I could be more greatly united in a shared sense of what Christian unity means and looks like.  The goal is not to convert or convince, but to converse - to come to a shared understanding.  This is important to me, being a new Catholic, having been Protestant - I recognize that there is so much I don't know, so much that I will eventually find out that I misunderstand, and that there's great value in more voices being heard - especially voices within my own "family" that I've never had an opportunity to hear before.  Thus, I am not writing to present a perfect solution to the problems of division, but hopefully one encouraging and upbuilding piece of the greater conversation.  I truly believe that every member of the Body is irreplaceably valuable, and we won't really understand unless we understand <i>together</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, know that these thoughts on unity come from a deep personal place of felt pains from division, mistakes and redemptions from within my own life, and much prayerful study... I hope you will find that this is a personal journey for you, as well as a theological exploration.</p>

<h2>The Gospel as Told by Division and Unity</h2>

<p>The first division ever was by a creature named Satan, or the Devil.</p>

<p>What does his name mean?</p>

<p>Accuser. Slanderer. Adversary.</p>

<p>Accuser - one who destroys trust.<br>
Slanderer - one who invents lies.<br>
Adversary - one who creates opposition.</p>

<p>One who creates...division.</p>

<p>What has his goal been since the beginning?</p>

<p>Dividing us from God.<br>
And then, dividing us from each other.</p>

<p>Note the most common letter in the word division.  Division is caused by putting yourself ("I") above others, and supremely by putting yourself above God.</p>

<p>Was this not the fall of Satan: putting himself above God - wanting to take the place that only God deserves, the place that truly only God, the Creator of all, can occupy rightly?</p>

<p>It was, as well, the fall of man.</p>

<p>Satan, and all the angels who followed him, wanted their way over God's.<br>
And Adam (at his worst), and all the humans who follow in sin, want their way over God's.<br>
"I" over you.  Division over unity.</p>

<p>But God is life; God is breath; God is the Creator and Sustainer of all that is.</p>

<p>Dividing oneself from God is separating the leaf from the branch, the earth from the sun, the head from the heart.</p>

<p>Division leads to crippled life.<br>
Division leads to decay.<br>
Division leads to death.</p>

<p>What is the opposite of division?<br>
What is the opposite of death?</p>

<p>When Jesus came, he became the Second Adam, the Reversal of the death caused by the separation of sin.</p>

<p>The Unifier.</p>

<p>Unifying us with God.<br>
Unifying us with each other.<br>
Life.</p>

<p>Where the Devil is the Divider, Jesus is the Unifier.</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"...that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us..."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">John 17:21</p>

<p>Praise to You, Lord Jesus Christ!<br>
You over "I"!  Unity over division!</p>

<p>Only through Jesus do human beings have any hope of true, full, life-giving unity.</p>

<p>For as division gives birth to death, factions, and hate, <br>
unity gives birth to life, family, and love.</p>

<p>Death to life.<br>
Factions to family...</p>

<p>This is the context for everything I will say here; this is the Gospel as told by division and unity.</p>


<h2>Visible Unity: One Table</h2>


<p>I would like first to make a definition of one phrase that I will refer to often in this conversation: "visible unity".  What do I mean by "a call to visible unity"?  What would it mean if the Church has reached "visible unity"?</p>

<p>Visible unity to me means three things that all relate to the biblical image of gathering around one table:</p>

<ol class="spaced-list">
  <li>Family unity - "being present at one table together" - praying together in the same places, worshipping together in the same buildings, and witnessing together to our common beliefs in God while being perceived as one united body to the world. If I meet any stranger in this family somewhere in the world, there are no theological barriers between us being fully present and joyful as believers with one another.</li>
  <li>Meal unity - "taking part in one meal together" - believing the same thing about Communion and being able to all take Communion together. This extends to believing the same things about the most important ways of receiving God's grace through the Church, such as sharing the same beliefs about Baptism. If I come to any table of this family in the world, I can know I'll be accepted as a member, and be able to participate fully in shared life and communion.</li>
  <li>Head of the Table unity - "having the same head of the table" - submitting to the same visible earthly leaders and spiritual authorities, as we would to Christ's originally appointed "Apostles", as representatives chosen and led by the Spirit through whom we are able to come to agreement on all major disputes and questions about faith and morals.</li>
</ol>

<p>"Whoa, whoa" - you may be saying - "you're getting ahead of yourself. I don't know if I agree with this...!"</p>

<p>In this definition of visible unity, I am merely proposing a "what" before the "why", so that we can communicate from a shared understanding of definitions.  This series of writings is primarily about potentially agreeing on this "what", through a Biblical "why", so we can come to a shared "how".  But we have to start somewhere, a potential "what" that we can discuss from in this conversation about "visible unity".</p>


<h2>Initial Ideas for Unity</h2>


<p>Growing up as a non-denominational Christian with a heart for unity in the Church, I had an initial set of ideas for how to achieve unity. According to the One Table definition as put forth above, my first ideas toward unity could be broken down like this:</p>

<ol class="spaced-list">
  <li>Family unity - "Let go of denominations and Church 'institutions' and we can all work together."</li>
  <li>Meal unity - "Let people believe what they want about communion, have an 'Open Table' (anyone who professes belief in Christ can partake), and we can all share a meal together."</li>
  <li>Head of the Table unity - "Let the Bible, as the definitive Word of God, be our common authority and any truly faithful leaders and believers will be able to agree on disputes of faith and morals that arise, through studying and applying Scripture properly."</li>
</ol>

<p>However, as I grew to have more interdenominational friendships and began to delve into the history and reasons for denominations, I started to recognize problems with these answers for visible unity:</p>

<ol class="spaced-list">
  <li>Humanity is naturally institutional.  From families, to governments, to schools and organizations at every size - the more people work together, the more intuitive it becomes that an institution is necessary.  On the opposite end, I've found that churches with less structure and hierarchy tend to have less visible unity and typically are concentrated only in one region, finding it very difficult to have shared unity, agreement, and communion across multiple cities and countries.</li>
  <li>'Open Table' communion is a good solution to allowing for disagreement in the Church.  The problem is when this allows for <i>increasing</i> disagreement to grow among members of the Body.  When certain core questions, like "how is one saved?" or "what does Baptism really mean?", are disagreed upon by members, I find it unsettling to hear "We allow each person to decide what to believe on these issues, but know that we can all still have communion together".  To me, this tends dangerously toward the relativism that is so prevalent in our world today, sometimes trading a deeper unity for a shallow "coexistence" by simply "agreeing to disagree".</li>
  <li>Having Scripture as the Church's only definitive authority is like saying a government or organization could write its beliefs and moral laws once and never have to add to or clarify them.  Even if that were the case, the institution would certainly still need an interpretive authority in judges and leaders who interpret and apply the original written documents to new situations.  (With Scripture, for example, churches differ on what gets interpreted <i>literally</i> versus <i>spiritually</i>. What does Paul mean when he says women should remain silent in Church? What does Jesus mean when he says the apostles can forgive sins? What does Jesus mean when he says "This is my body"?)  Thus churches need some kind of <i>interpretive authority</i>, formed of human authority, in addition to the Bible.</li>
</ol>

<p class="small-font" style="margin-top:1.5em;">Additional Note (to clarify some of the points above): I believe that a healthy Church should allow differing opinions on certain doctrines, but not others.  Some differing opinions, such as on baptism and salvation, actually change what one means when saying "I am a Christian", or "I am baptized" or "I am saved".  These kind of foundational definitions have historically been called "dogmas", meaning doctrines that a Church holds as unchanging truths.</p>

<p class="small-font" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">On the other end, we don't have to agree on <i>everything</i>, such as choosing one favorite style of worship, or enforcing uniform holiday traditions and fasting observances (like Romans chapter 14 discusses), but we must at least agree on what needs agreement in order to have unity as a Church. This comes from a shared understanding of what gets appreciated as <i>diversity</i>, and what is acknowledged as <i>division</i> from core dogmas.  I will not attempt to form or present a list of what belongs where; in <i>this</i> discussion that would be losing the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>As my desire for Christian unity grew, I eventually realized the core of my initial ideas really was trying to be content with a lesser unity than Jesus prayed for.  I realized that the Trinity has called us to share <i>their</i> unity, a fuller, body-and-soul sort of unity, and this is a high call. It is like our personal faith which is not merely an intellectual or spiritual faith, but a faith also that affects our visible life. So too Christian unity must not be an intellectual or spiritual reality alone, but also a physical, earthly, visible reality as well.</p>

<p>The problem with "agreeing to disagree" as Christians is that we are called to agree. </p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, <b>that all of you agree</b> and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment...</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Corinthians 1:10</p>

<p>It is true, that no matter what denomination, the closer two people are to Jesus Christ, <i>the closer those two people are to each other</i>. Thus I of course feel much closer to any one given faithful Christian in another denomination than a nominal Christian in my own.</p>

<p>But my words on unity are directed to those who are already truly faithful and devoted across different denominations. </p>

<p>Why should we remain visibly divided by our denominational walls? </p>

<p>My claim is that among all faithful, devoted Christians, we should work <i>towards</i> a <b>visible</b> unity, and <i>against</i> the visible splits of denominations.</p>


<h2>The Devil in Denominations</h2>


<p>The first claim I hope we can share on this road to unity is that the divisions of the Church into denominations should not exist, and were caused by sin.</p>

<p>To be clear, I am not aiming to blame or shame with anything here.  The divisions of denominations for the vast majority of us believers are inherited, and <b>not primarily caused by the sins of present-day Christians</b> who were born into these separations.</p>

<p>However, what I <i>am</i> saying is that the divisions remain as a <i>consequence</i> of past sins, and we all should aim for reconciliation.  No matter where we are.  No matter where we come from.  We all have a part to play in the work of unity.  Reconciliation cannot happen without allowing different voices to be heard, and different parts of the Body moving closer together.</p>

<p>Thus I am not writing to accuse specific groups or certain instances of division, but to come to a shared understanding of the <i>nature</i> of denominational splits.</p>

<p><b>For just as an understanding of the gospel begins with an understanding of sin, but leads us to unity with the Father through Christ...so also an understanding of a united Church begins with an understanding of a sinfully divided Church, but will hopefully lead us together to unity.</b></p>

<!-- <p>To reconcile and heal the effects of sin and start on this path towards greater hope of unity, we must know what we are reconciling, and why we are reconciling it.  Only a shared understanding of the true and present nature of the divisions can start to build the bridges, the reconciliation between denominations. </p>
 -->
<p>I believe that denominations are not "different expressions of the Church" or "different flavors for different types of people", but that, fundamentally, the Church was never called to be set into these kind of visible splits and institutional divides.  The Church was, and is, called to maintain its diversity of "parts" within a visible unity, a visible Body of Christ, visibly together at One Table as were our Lord and His disciples.</p>

<p>So why do I say so adamantly that the various divisions of the Church (into denominations) were sinful?</p>

<p>There are two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Denominational splits do not correspond to the will of Christ.</li>
  <li>The existence of denominations weakens the Church in the exercise of its mission.</li>
</ol>

<p class="small-font">(Note: the wording of these two points is from <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_25031993_principles-and-norms-on-ecumenism_en.html">this document</a>, p. 19)</p>

<h3>1. Denominations do not correspond to the will of Christ.</h3>


<p>In the Bible there are only calls to unity; no such divisions like denominations were promoted in the early Church:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Now the full number of those who believed were of <b>one heart and soul</b>, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but <b>they had everything in common</b>.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Acts 4:32</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">For in one Spirit we were all <b>baptized into one body</b> - Jews or Greeks, slaves or free - and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Cor 12:13</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Aim for restoration, comfort one another, <b>agree with one another</b>, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">2 Cor 13:11</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Finally, all of you, have <b>unity of mind</b>, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Peter 3:8</p>

<p>And in the New Testament, each time things like denominations or severe doctrinal dissensions are spoken of, they are rebuked:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">I appeal to you, brothers, to <b>watch out for those who cause divisions</b> and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; <b>avoid them</b>.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Romans 16:17</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in"><b>If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree</b> with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, <b>he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing</b>. He has an <b>unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words</b>, which produce envy, <b>dissension</b>, slander, evil <b>suspicions</b>, and <b>constant friction</b> among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Timothy 6:3-5</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">charge them before God <b>not to quarrel</b> about words...have nothing to do with <b>foolish, ignorant controversies</b>; you know that they breed quarrels...</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">2 Timothy 2:14,23</p>

<p>To be sure, some arguments about doctrine can be fruitful.  But those which divide the Church into warring factions by nature have their root, at some origin, in sin and not love.</p>

<p>Paul explicitly calls out the formation of factions as being sinful:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, <b>dissensions, factions</b> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Galatians 5:19-21 (NIV)</p>

<p>The fact that denominations are somewhat "normal" or accepted allows Christians to, instead of resolving their differences inside the united body like a family would, "resolve disagreements" by factions and splits that divide the family of God in a way God never intended.  </p>

<p>These divisions in the family of God resemble to me the ways divorce tears a family apart, which Jesus also commands against.</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Matthew 19:6b</p>

<p>For marriage is something where God has profoundly brought two separate people together into one body:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"So they are no longer two but one flesh."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Matthew 19:6a</p>

<p>In a similar way, has not God brought together many people into one Body of the Church? For Peter writes:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Once you were no people but now you are God's people...<br>
you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation...<br>
like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house...</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Peter 2:10,9,5</p>

<p>Denominational divisions, then, have their roots in factions, which have multiple Biblical condemnations and the sinful quality of tearing apart what God has joined together. Such divisions of denominations, therefore, are not in the will of Christ for his Church.</p>


<h3>2. The existence of denominations weakens the Church in the exercise of its mission.</h3>


<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"...that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me..."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">John 17:23</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">In those days there was no king [read: no united group of people] in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Judges 21:25</p>

<p>Does our Church resemble more the people living out the prayer of Jesus, or the people living at the time of the book of Judges?</p>

<p>I have received before the objection in my witness (often from those trying to understand the Bible for the first time amid conflicting interpretations) something like "Why should I trust Christians to tell me what's true when <i>they</i> can't even agree on what's true?"</p>

<p>Instead of coming into one unified family, new believers must pick (usually without their knowledge) a "side" of a family dispute which no one they know started and over denominational matters which people spend their lifetimes studying. This fact of denominations greatly hinders so many potential believers' faith journey to understand Christ. These disputes, quite visible to the world, damage the reputation of the Church as well as dim the reality of the Gospel's power to unite and reconcile people.</p>

<p>Within the Church, denominational disputes often reduce the Church's collective time and energy able to be given to our central missions.</p>

<p>Think of how a denomination begins: it is first born of (usually lengthy) argument between Church members. Then one group of members "moves out" and establishes a new place to meet, must appoint new leaders, develop a new structure, and figure out and compose new or revised doctrinal statements.</p>

<p>Think of the amount of energy given over to division and "re-creation" in this process.  And there are <i>thousands</i> of Christian denominations.</p>

<p class="small-font">A brief aside: This is not to trivialize why denominational splits happen. It is clear that people on both sides of Church splits do not ultimately want a split to happen.  But why they <i>do</i> split is often in the pursuit of truth. The rest of the writings in this series will be aimed at how we can avoid this kind of split and work to diminish and remove dividing walls between faithful, loving Christians, while not compromising the truths of our faith. It is no simple task. In this first section, I merely aim to assess the scope and severity of the problems caused by the existence of denominations.</p>

<p>These duplicated and divided efforts continue into subsequent generations of divided believers.  Churches within the same city wrestle with similar moral and theological issues but are, in many ways, prevented from collaborating.  Churches may seek to serve the same needs in society, but often do not pool together resources.  And some churches have no place of their own to meet while other churches in the same area have inherited beautiful buildings that are a lot of work to maintain yet don't have enough members to do so.</p>

<p>Think of all the blessings among Christians that are not able to be shared!</p>

<p>As Paul writes, "a person who stirs up division" can cause much unprofitable time to be spent by the Church:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">...<b>avoid foolish controversies</b>...<b>dissensions</b>...for they are <b>unprofitable</b> and <b>worthless</b>.  <b>As for a person who stirs up division</b>, after warning him once and then twice, <b>have nothing more to do with him</b>, knowing that <b>such a person is warped and sinful</b>; he is self-condemned.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Titus 3:9-11</p>

<p>Therefore, we are called by Scripture to strongly avoid this kind of stirring up of division that leads to separation of the Body's efforts.</p>

<p>Finally, the existence of denominations also weakens the Church's ability to preach one truth, by causing "mists of error [and] clouds of doubt", as one hymn puts it, to spread throughout the people of God.  Here are a select few examples of the kinds of questions that have caused denominational splits:</p>

<p>How is one saved?<br>
Is baptism required for salvation?<br>
Can I lose my salvation?<br>
Are a select few predestined to be saved, or is it a choice every person makes?<br>
Does the church need to forgive grave sins or can I just ask God on my own?<br>
Is communion an essential miracle or a helpful metaphor?<br>
Do miracles like healings and speaking in tongues still happen?<br>
How should the Church be structured in its leadership?<br>
Who decides what interpretation of Scripture is true when disputes arise?<br>
Who decides what are the "core issues" that need agreement?</p>

<p>This confusion of doctrinal differences is one of the greatest darknesses in all the Church.</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">For God is <b>not a God of confusion</b> but of peace.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Corinthians 14:33</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">God is light, and <b>in him is no darkness at all</b>. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth...</p>
<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">But <b>if we walk in the light</b>, as he is in the light, <b>we have fellowship with one another</b>, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 John 1:5-7</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, let us not walk in the darkness.</p>

<p>Let us aim for a deeper, more united fellowship with one another.</p>


<h3>Acknowledging Sin to Seek Unity</h3>


<p>The Bible, reason, and experience all stand witness before you and I that denominational splits were caused by sin.  Through sin, Christians have been divided from one another, and thus more greatly hindered from knowing and showing God in the world.</p>

<p>I have often heard reasoning like "as long as we agree on the gospel, it's okay."</p>

<p>It is true that all Christians share a very real and profound Christian communion across all denominations, and that we are truly Christian family by agreeing with the gospel, being baptized, and sharing the Bible as the true, inspired Word of God.</p>

<p>But we cannot avoid the imperfect nature of present-day inter-denominational communion.</p>

<p>It's not okay that denominations have no biblical basis, only biblical condemnation.<br>
It's not okay that denominations are rooted in sinful dissensions and factions.<br>
It's not okay that we are demonstrably a broken family to the world.<br>
It's not okay that denominational splits reduce our collective time and energy directed to our central missions.<br>
And lastly: it's really not okay that Christians disagree on major questions of doctrine and truth.</p>

<p>Denominations do not correspond to the will of Christ, and weaken His Church in the exercise of its mission.</p>

<p>This isn't a fun message to bring, and it's not an exciting place to start.  But as John writes:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us...</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 John 1:8</p>

<p>Thus let us acknowledge this sin in the hope of having a shared "truth in us", and hopefully agree here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>denominations were not intended by God in the design of His Church</li>
  <li>denominational splits were caused by sin</li>
  <li>most of us were born into these denominational splits, and are not at fault for their existence</li>
  <li>for reconciliation to happen between denominations, we need to together acknowledge these past sins as sin and these present denominational splits as undesired</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the baseline I'll continue with. For, as I said before, just as an understanding of the gospel begins with an understanding of sin, so this conversation of unity must begin with an understanding of the sinful nature of Church division, and will hopefully lead us from this basis to a shared vision of the Church more fully united.</p>

<p>Adding on to the points above, with a more inward focus, I believe that for <i>further</i> reconciliation to happen and for a true hope of unity to happen, we (and I'm very much including myself here!) need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acknowledge our own indifference or lack of love towards being more wholly and visibly united with Christians of other denominations</li>
  <li>acknowledge our own prideful ("I"-focused) sins of the present that may be perpetuating divisions and denominations</li>
  <li>acknowledge our own misunderstandings, lack of knowledge, and lack of shared vision for what God has intended the design of His healthy and united Church to be</li>
</ul>

<p>If reading this has been purely intellectual so far (as these discussions can tend towards), allow the Holy Spirit to bring out what discord lies in your heart in regards to unity and differences among Christians.  Have you been wronged?  Do you need to forgive?  Do you need to repent?  Do you need to seek a new understanding with someone or about something?</p>

<p>These are your own reflections to make, but looking at the third point - the design of what a united Church would look like and how we could get there together - that is everything I want to talk about in this series of writings.</p>

<p>I have started with talking about sin, but I promise it gets more hopeful and exciting from here.  The goal of this first part, and my hope, is that we can start with this agreement.  If so, we have already progressed on the path to unity.  No matter what denomination you come from, or any of the specific doctrinal issues we might differ on, we can start here, at the basis of reconciliation, and be able to come to the table humble, honest, repentant, and expectant, with a hope that the Holy Spirit could unite us and reconcile Christians unto a shared understanding.</p>


<h2>Can Denominations Come Together?</h2>


<p>I've discussed a lot of ideas in the abstract: interdenominational reconciliation, undoing the denominational splits...but what does this look like in practice?  Is this big vision of interdenominational unity even possible?</p>

<p>In 1999 there was a rather significant event in interdenominational unity - I'll let excerpts of the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html">Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</a> do the talking:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">From the Reformation perspective, justification was the crux of all the disputes. Doctrinal condemnations were put forward both in the Lutheran Confessions and by the Roman Catholic Church's Council of Trent.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">paragraph 1</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">[This declaration encompasses] a consensus on basic truths of the doctrine of justification and shows that the remaining differences in its explication are no longer the occasion for doctrinal condemnations.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">p. 5</p>

<p>Did you catch that - the mutual condemnations between Lutherans and Catholics from the Reformation "<i>are no longer</i>"!  It's not saying that no differences remain, but the <b>main reason</b> that the churches split is <i>gone</i>.</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">...<b>there are still questions of varying importance</b> which need further clarification. These include, among other topics, the relationship between the Word of God and church doctrine, as well as ecclesiology [Church structure], ecclesial authority [Church leadership], church unity, ministry, the sacraments [Baptism, Communion, etc], and the relation between justification and social ethics.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">p. 43</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">We give thanks to the Lord for this decisive step forward on the way to <b>overcoming the division of the church</b>. We ask the Holy Spirit to lead us further toward that <b>visible unity</b> which is Christ's will.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">p. 44</p>

<p>Thus visible unity is not only possible, but developing in the Church today in significant ways.</p>


<h2>The Movement of Unity</h2>


<p>Not only in that monumental declaration, but the last 50 years as a whole have shown a surge in dialogue between denominations. Christian leaders like never before are increasing in their openness to humbly come to the same table and converse about their differences, from all sides of the Church's denominational landscape.</p>

<p>Traditional churches are notably becoming more open to dialogue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 1948 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_of_Churches">World Council of Churches</a> was established to foster communication across most major denominations and together in 1982 formed a significant agreement called '<a href="https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/commissions/faith-and-order/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text">Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry</a>'. </li>
  <li>Dialogues between the Catholic Church and many Christian denominations have grown through the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, started in 1960. Their <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/index.htm">webpage</a> has a notable list of past and current efforts.</li>
  <li>In 2016, leaders from the Lutheran, Catholic, and later, Methodist Churches, agreed to a declaration of 32 shared statements about what the Church is and what it is called to, titled '<a href="http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/Declaration_on_the_Way.pdf?_ga=2.113119748.1436308497.1526169643-1164456379.1526169643">Declaration on the Way</a>'.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, more "modern" churches are becoming more open to engaging with traditional churches through an increasing interest and openness to liturgy [a structured, formulated order of worship] and Church history. Relevant Magazine (a non-denominational Christian magazine) <a href="https://relevantmagazine.com/god/church/why-church-history-matters">writes</a>, "we've seen the pendulum swing in recent years from an emergent, functionally anti-historical church trend...into liturgically richer and/or more historically rooted Christian traditions."</p>

<p>I am beginning to see and believe in a greater movement of unity happening not only on the institutional level of our churches, but also on the level of dozens of personal stories I've encountered, from believers drawn, in their own faith journeys, to greater unity. Whether it's a friend who goes out of one's comfort zone to explore thousand-year-old styles of worship, to another reading first-hand sources of early Church history, to leaders I know in more traditional Churches newly embracing charismatic expressions of faith, I sense that Christians are feeling a shared pull to draw closer together in an increasingly divisive and relativistic world.</p>

<p>I sense a very tangible movement of the Holy Spirit developing among our generation, leading to many considering their denominational origins, desiring a more profound unity of all that is good, and hoping to see in our day a greater closeness of all God's children.</p>


<h2>Winning and Losing</h2>

<p>I used to think that if two denominations came together, it would be that one is winning and the other losing.  That the only hope of denominational unity is for everyone to leave behind everything from one denomination and adopt everything from another.  One night at church radically opened my eyes and changed this for me.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 2017, when I had not yet become Catholic and at the same time was grieving over what felt like so much separation from my Protestant family. The night before Pentecost, I went to a church service with both Protestant and Catholic friends. It was a Catholic mass, yet was filled with what seemed more "Protestant" (read: modern) worship music, including many songs from my childhood...songs from important seasons of growth in my spiritual journey, reminding me of all the good and wonderful experiences and blessings from the Protestant Churches I grew up in. I was flooded with emotion and praise, feeling like God was bringing together all my valued and treasured experiences into one place of worship and awe. My heart was filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>And I realized something. The Unity of God leaves out nothing that is truly good.</p>

<p>When denominations come together, with the right approach, we lose nothing of what is good. </p>

<p>We lose only the division. </p>

<p>And we win the gifts of each other.</p>


<h2>Jesus' Prayer: For Visible Unity</h2>


<p>Let us return to Jesus' prayer in John 17 and ask: why does Jesus choose, seemingly above all else, to pray for unity as his last big prayer before going to the Cross?  Is it not because He must know that division would be such a real threat to His Church?  Is it not because He knew that only through such self-sacrifice as He would demonstrate on the Cross, believers would have the power to be united? </p>

<p>I believe Jesus was praying against divisions in the Church because <b>He knew divisions would be the <i>primary danger</i> to the Church's life and witness</b>.  And that the divisions would take much prayer and self-sacrifice (like the Cross) to overcome.</p>

<p>Much of what I have written here is in response to ideas that I have heard some say, ideas which diminish the importance of Jesus' prayer for unity, that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this prayer of Jesus has already been answered through a concept of the "invisible unity" of believers through the Holy Spirit</li>
  <li>this prayer, assuming it is for visible unity of the Church, will not be answered until Christ returns; things will only get worse and more divided until Jesus comes to set all things right</li>
</ul>

<p>But these views either result from a too-small faith for what is possible in the Church or a too-low hope in what kind of reconciliation can be possible among Christians when the power of the Gospel comes alive.</p>

<p>I know, in the depth of my heart, that Christ is not praying for invisible unity in his Church, or some future unity out of reach. He is praying for a greater sense of <i>real</i> and <i>visible unity</i> for His Church, right now. For unity in the Church as a mirror of how the Trinity is united, in a <i>real</i> and <i>full</i> and <i>complete</i> unity.</p>

<p>When Jesus prayed, "...that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee...", he was not praying for this kind of unity to be realized only once we get to heaven, since right after he says "so that the <i>world</i> may believe that thou hast sent me."</p>

<p>He was also not just praying for the early Church, for he says, "I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word..."</p>

<p>Thus he prays not only for the early Church, nor just for the heavenly Church to come, but for us. Here. Now. In all the generations after the original apostles. That we would be more greatly one, like the Trinity is one. </p>

<p>And it is right there in the prayer of all prayers, the Lord's Prayer..."on earth as it is in heaven."</p>


<h2>The Mirror of Heavenly Unity</h2>


<p>Are there denominations in heaven?  Let us peek into the book of Revelation:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Then [the angel] spoke to me, saying, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb." And in the Spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God... It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates... And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Revelation 21:9-14</p>

<p>I see nowhere in Scripture to indicate that there will be dividing walls <i>inside</i> the heavenly city of God, which is the Lamb's Bride, the everlasting Church.</p>

<p>The only wall I see is the outer wall, representing to me the solid and lasting truths of the faith that hold together the people of God in the eternal city of unchanging truth, separating them distinctly from the false beliefs, prideful knowledge, fleeting achievements, and temporary kingdoms of this earth that will pass away...</p>

<p>There are a diversity of gates by which people enter this kingdom, that is true, representing the diversity of the Church even amidst its unity, and the ways, the journeys, the testimonies by which people have entered this Kingdom.</p>

<p>But once the people of God are inside this everlasting city, are they known by different denominations?</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">...the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">Revelation 22:3-4</p>

<p>They share one name...one faith...one God...written on their foreheads visibly as a mark of their visible unity in his Name, their visible gathering, eternally, into one people.</p>


<h2>A Call to Visible Unity</h2>


<p>If there are no walls in the heavenly Kingdom of God, why would we rest content with walls in His Earthly Kingdom, among His people here?  We must see and know that our denominational divisions do not continue in the realm of perfect unity and love.  Thus to bring that heaven to earth, we too must recognize that these divisions have no place among God's people.  We must approach reconciliation together, with the humility that no one of us "has it all" and only together are we designed to be complete.  We must hope together for unity, "on earth as it is in heaven".</p>

<p>Thus it really is a high call for us, as the Church, to be one, as Jesus prayed for us to be one.  This prayer in John 17 is remarkable and should have a profound impact on what we believe the Church could be and should be, for us, and for the world.  That Jesus asks this of his Father should make us also ask this in our prayer and seek it out in our lives.</p>

<p>Seeking this out, however, is costly. It takes tremendous endeavours from <i>each</i> generation of the Church to both hold on to existing unity and foster increased unity. It takes time to honestly investigate and authentically unpack the truths of Christ as they apply to each generation and to each new set of controversies in the Church.  It also takes time to undo the emotional, spiritual, and physical damages of the ages of the Church generations before us.  It takes incredible willingness to admit wrongs, have compassion, and radically forgive our brothers and sisters in Christ, sometimes up to seventy times seven times.  For unity to be present in the Church, there must be present incredible holiness, risky faith, and self-sacrifice on the level of martyrdom.</p>

<p>The first step we can all lean into is to recognize the time, energy, and self-sacrifice it takes to bring about visible unity. It is not something that can simply be inherited freely, but must be constantly maintained and rebuilt through striving, great discernment, and wisdom.  All the intricate natures of the various present and past divisions in the Church cannot be explained or solved through merely one piece of writing, one conversation, or even one person's life or movement alone. </p>

<p>But we can each begin this work of unity by better understanding the fundamental realities of present-day divisions, agreeing upon what we are trying to work against, and agreeing on what we are trying to work towards.</p>

<p>How do we seek out this visible unity in our lives, in a tangible way?  I think of Jesus' "great commandment" which summarizes everything I could hope to say about how to achieve unity:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Love one another."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">John 13:34</p>

<p>Yet to me, most of all, the sins of the denominational splits testifies to our still-incomplete journey and visibly present lack of love within the Church universal.  I believe that reconciling these sins and divisions should be one of the primary ways we seek to live out the gospel's reconciliation and peace on this earth, for the visible disunity of Christian believers contradicts by its nature what Jesus commands as essential for our witness:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">John 13:35</p>

<p>Without visible unity, the Body of Christ cannot fully follow Jesus' central command to love one another. Without visible unity, the Church cannot fully be a light to the world as true disciples of Christ, our Christ who is One Body, and One with the Trinity.</p>

<p>Paul cuts to the heart:</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree...</p>
<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">Is Christ divided?</p>
<p class="small-font quote-text close-in">1 Corinthians 1:10, 13</p>

<p>Is Christ divided, in any way, within himself? Then why would Christ intend for his Body, in any way, to be divided within itself?</p>

<hr>

<p>I end this chapter of our conversation with this question about the Body of Christ, to linger in our minds and stir in our hearts.  To stir up the hope and the desire of unity...</p>
