        <p>I didn't expect to cry.  I didn't expect to not be able to stop crying.</p>

        <p>January 2, 2014 is a day I will never forget.  It is the day that I was able to see Jerusalem with my own eyes, and walk in the path that Jesus walked to his crucifixion.</p>

        <p>Our tour group, on a trip with the <a href="http://www.davidproject.org/" target="_blank">David Project</a>, that day walked 'Via Dolorosa', known as the Stations of the Cross.  These are the words I wrote in my journal that night:</p>

        <p class="left-indent">"At station V, where Jesus stumbled and had to let another carry his cross, there is an indent in the wall where they believe he touched the wall to get balance.  Our tour guide, Ya El, told me to stay there and tell each person in our group what it was as they walked by.  People asked me to put my hand in it for a picture.  Then, as I walked away, behind the whole group, a wave of emotion came over me as I thought about Jesus, the very Son of God, stumbling under the weight of the cross.  And some man I walked past said, 'Jesus was here,' and it just hit me so hard.  It was something like I've never felt before."</p>

My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers</pre>

        <p>Later I would kneel at the very place where Jesus's cross is said to have been placed into the ground.  I turned off my hearing aids and spent a quiet moment with God, thanking him for his forgiveness of my sins and his incomprehensible grace.</p>

        <p>That day Jesus became very real to me - in physical rocks and in emotional tears.  The only God who would come down as a human being and suffer and die for our sake - what immense love, what a weight it is to truly believe that.</p>

        <p>Below is a video from snapshots I took of that powerful day, set to the song quoted above.  The song speaks directly to the story I had resonating in my head and the emotions I felt as I walked through the places where Jesus had walked, prayed, suffered, and died.</p>

        <p>It features the picture a friend took of my hand in the spot where Jesus stumbled, as well as a video my friend secretly took of me as I kneeled at the spot of the cross.</p>

        <p>The Easter before the trip to Israel, when I had no idea that I would be walking in the place where Jesus walked just less than a year later, I wrote the following poem, titled 'What is Love?'.</p>

        <p>This poem to me brings to mind the heart of Jesus, the humanity of Jesus, and the response of love that his life, death and resurrection call out to us to participate in.</p>

      <div class="poetry-container no-padding">
        <pre class="poetry">He knew he was going to die.
He could have turned back.
He even said he wanted to.
But he didn't.

He was full of wisdom.
He could have spoken truth to people who needed it.
He could have healed many with more time.
But they killed him.

He knew they would kill him.
He could have offered the best arguments against them.
His friends must have seen such injustice.
But he remained silent in all his knowledge.

He was tortured brutally.
He could resisted and overpowered any of it.
He could have shut up the mockers around him in a heart beat.
But his heart beat too strongly for that.

His heart beat too strongly for them.
His heart beat too strongly for us.

"This is how we know what love is:
Jesus Christ laid down his life for us."

He was love in its purest form.
A powerful love.
Striking in its humility.
Foolish even in our eyes.
But it is the love our hearts know they were made for.

"And we ought to lay down our lives
for our brothers."</pre>
