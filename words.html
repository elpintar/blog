How temporary are
              the words today
    barely a thought
                       then made
  O God
              how fleeting they really are
      they flash
           they flicker
                    then fade

Words make up clouds
              that gather round us
    warping the light
                       coming through
  a truth that seems
              to rise and fall
      but really
           it is us
                    that do

I see the ruins
              of days long past
    among new roots
                       and new years
  and remember how springs
              of changing streams
      through the
           same rock
                    all steer

Upon a rock
              Great Hands once wrote
    the Way
                 we could understand    
  but people turned
              the people strayed
      and traded
           the Rock
                    for sand

Through many hands
              these words were passed
    words from
                      outside of time
  then the Author came down
              in sentences fulfilled
      and in a three day
           period
                    unlocked the words divine

Listen all
              with ears to hear
    gaze with your eyes
                       and see
  cast away the haze
              of shifting days
      and grasp
           what forever
                    will be

From ears and eyes
              to hands and feet
    these words were meant
                       to move
  we are all translators
              from words to lives
      through blessings
           old promises
                    are proved

Do not weep
              for ruins that were
    don't fear the ones
                       to come
  upon these words
              a kingdom is built
      of which not all
           will find
                    but some

Many ask why God
                   seems so silent
    and some say that He
                 is dead
  I ask you why
             the people are waiting
      for the words
             that have already
                    been said

There is nothing new
              under the sun
    just clouds that
                       slip away
  join with me
              let's root our lives
      in words
           that never
                               fade.
