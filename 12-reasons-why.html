  <title>Why I Am Becoming Catholic</title>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Why I Am Becoming Catholic"/>
  <meta property="og:description" content="I know this may be a shock to many of you - it is still to myself in many ways: I have decided to become Catholic. Three months ago I was an Evangelical, nondenominational Protestant. How did I get here? Questions. Lots of questions, in what was really a five-and-a-half-year journey. Lots of doubts, lots of reading Scripture, lots of hard conversations, lots of submitting everything once again to God and asking Him to lead me... This post is the answer to that question as told through the story of how I decided to become a Roman Catholic."/>

<p>Many folks have asked me since writing <a href="./why-I-am-becoming-Catholic.html">Why I Am Becoming Catholic</a> how it has been.  I usually have difficulty responding and say something like "there has been so much...I am so grateful".  Yet with this experience has come the strong feeling that I know next to nothing about God and additionally there is so much I need to unlearn and be corrected in.  Thus I have had a fear of promulgating too much as a neophyte and speaking with all sorts of Catholic jargon and teaching heresy I don't yet realize is heresy and things like that.</p>

<p>But there has been a sort of peace as I hit the two year mark since deciding irrevocably to become Catholic on January 22, 2017.  I feel that I am starting to be able to share more fully what it's like to be a Catholic Christian with people that I care deeply about, in a way that is poor and slow and allows room for misunderstanding.  And I am learning to do this more and more in the way of Christ, who said "I do not speak on my own authority" (John 12:49).</p>

<p>So in this post I'll share 12 reasons I'm grateful to be Catholic, and do this by pointing to other authorities who can speak more authoritatively, compellingly, and eloquently than I about these things.</p>


<h3>1. All the crucifixes</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+12%3A20-50&version=RSV" target="_blank">John 12:24</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"In the eschatological fulfillment mercy will be revealed as love, while in the temporal phase, in human history, which is at the same time the history of sin and death, love must be revealed above all as mercy and must also be actualized as mercy."</p>

<h3>2. Realizing "on Earth as it is in heaven" is possible</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"...the saint says little about prayer life as such but a great deal about doing the will of the Father. She remarks that in the first three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interior_Castle" target="_blank">mansions</a> human nature is an oppressive burden on the spirit, 'like a great load of earth'. She adds that it shall be otherwise in the following mansions."</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Over the course of John Paul's papacy, a half billion people saw him in person, which is arguably more than anyone in human history. He traveled 775,000 miles to spread the gospel, which is more than three times the distance from the earth to the moon. He made 146 trips within Italy and 104 abroad to 129 nations to deliver more than 3,000 speeches... And he did most of this after the age at which most people retire..."</p>

<h3>4. Hyperdulia</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple...a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child..."</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"If Jesus Christ, the Head of men, is born in her, then the predestinate, who are the members of that Head, ought also to be born in her, by necessary of consequence. One and the same mother does not bring forth into the world the head without the members, or the member without the head; for this would be a monster of nature. So in like manner, in order of grace, the head and the members are born of one and the same Mother..."</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Picture then the High Priest Christ leaving the sacristy of heaven for the altar of Calvary. He has already put on the vestment of our human nature, the maniple of our suffering, the stole of priesthood, the chasuble of the Cross. Calvary is his cathedral; the rock of Calvary is the altar stone; the sun turning to red is the sanctuary lamp; Mary and John are the living side altars; the Host is His Body; the wine is His Blood. He is upright as Priest, yet He is prostrate as Victim. His Mass is about to begin."</p>

<h3>6. Perpetual Adoration / Holy Hours</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."</p>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"As Saint Augustine put it...'no one eats that flesh without first adoring it; we should sin were we not to adore it.' In the Eucharist, the Son of God comes to meet us and desires to become one with us; eucharistic adoration is simply the natural consequence of the eucharistic celebration, which is itself the Church's supreme act of adoration."</p>

<h3>7. Understanding Proselytization vs. Evangelization</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven...I am not the Christ...He must increase, but I must decrease."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A22-30&version=RSV" target="_blank">John 3:27-30</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"'Let the men eaten up with activity,' he says, 'and who imagine they are able to shake the world with their preaching and other outward works, stop and reflect a moment. It will not be difficult for them to understand that they would be much more useful to the Church and more pleasing to the Lord, not to mention the good example they would give to those around them, if they devoted more time to prayer and to the exercises of the interior life.'"</p>

<h3>8. The meaning of the word catholic</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"that they may all be one...so that the world may believe that you have sent me..."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+17%3A20-26&version=RSV" target="_blank">John 17:21</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"The children who are born into [non-Catholic Christian denominations] and who grow up believing in Christ cannot be accused of the sin involved in the separation, and the Catholic Church embraces upon them as brothers, with respect and affection.<br><br>

For men who believe in Christ and have been truly baptized are in communion with the Catholic Church even though this communion is imperfect.<br><br>

...it remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html" target="_blank">Unitatis Redintegratio (Restoration of Unity)</a>, Vatican II, 1964</p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Indeed, the elements of sanctification and truth present in the other Christian Communities, in a degree which varies from one to the other, constitute the objective basis of the communion, albeit imperfect, which exists between them and the Catholic Church.<br><br>

To the extent that these elements are found in other Christian Communities, the one Church of Christ is effectively present in them. For this reason the Second Vatican Council speaks of a certain, though imperfect communion. The Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium stresses that the Catholic Church "recognizes that in many ways she is linked" with these Communities by a true union in the Holy Spirit."</p>

<h3>9. My True Sexual Identity</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A26-31&version=RSV" target="_blank">Genesis 1:27</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"...already, on the first page of the Bible, we learn that man can't be explained as a merely physical being - a collection of cells, tissues, and organs. Human beings transcend the categories of chemistry and biology. Ultimately, man can only be understood in relation to God. This great mystery of creation - that we are created in God's image - is the key reference point for understanding all aspects of humanity, including our sexuality...<br><br>

Later, when Eve is created, Adam understands - as soon as he lays eyes on her - that men and women are fundamentally alike, yet different in complementary ways. Before she even speaks a word, Eve's body reveals all this and more. The body reveals the person. This phrase tells us all there is to know about the body. Science can examine our flesh in minute detail, down to our cells and even our DNA. But no amount of scientific exploration can replace the truth that our bodies reveal us, giving form to our innermost being and unique personality. Our bodies are sacramental - they make the invisible visible."</p>

<h3>10. Having a Spiritual Director</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you..."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt+23%3A1-12&version=RSV" target="_blank">Matthew 23:2-3</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Is it such a great matter if you, who are but dust and nothingness, subject yourself to man for the sake of God, when I, the All-Powerful, the Most High, Who created all things out of nothing, humbly subjected Myself to man for your sake?"</p>

<br>

<h3>11. The Liturgy of the Hours</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"And they devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the community, to the breaking of the bread, and to prayer..."</p>
<p class="small-font alt-quote-text close-in"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A37-47&version=RSV" target="_blank">Acts 2:42</a></p><br>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"The witness of the early Church teaches us that individual Christians devoted themselves to prayer at fixed times. Then, in different places, it soon became the established practice to assign special times for common prayer, for example, the last hour of the day when evening draws on and the lamp is lighted, or the first hour when night draws to a close with the rising of the sun.<br><br>

In the course of time other hours came to be sanctified by prayer in common. These were seen by the Fathers as foreshadowed in the Acts of the Apostles. There we read of the disciples gathered together at the third hour. The prince of the apostles "went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour" (10:9); "Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour" (3:1); "about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God" (16:25).<br><br>

Such prayer in common gradually took the form of a set cycle of hours. This liturgy of the hours or divine office, enriched by readings, is principally a prayer of praise and petition. Indeed, it is the prayer of the Church with Christ and to Christ."</p>

<h3>12. Monthly Confession</h3>

<p class="quote-looking quote-text close-in">"Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.' And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.'"</p>
