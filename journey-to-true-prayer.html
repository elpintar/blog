        <h2>A Confession</h2>

        <p>Every good follower of God prays, right?</p>

        <p>Well, a confession...I didn't for a long time. At least by the way I now define prayer.</p>

        <p>It took seven years after I first fully committed my life to follow Jesus, and four years after <a href="./journey-to-the-bible.html">starting to read the Bible</a>.</p>

        <p>What it took was being in the depths of feeling isolated, alone and dissatisfied with the Christians around me.</p>

        <p>It was only then I started to pray.</p>

        <p>This is the story of that season, the strange but curious jumping-off point of my journey of talking with God like a friend.</p>

        <p class="quote-looking">How tragic that we in this dark day have had our seeking done for us by our teachers. Everything is made to center upon the initial act of "accepting" Christ (a term, incidentally, which is not found in the Bible) and we are not expected thereafter to crave any further revelation of God to our souls. We have been snared in the coils of a spurious logic which insists that if we have found Him we need no more seek Him.</p>

        <h2>The Unglamorous Prelude to a Conversation</h2>

        <p>It was the summer after I turned 20, after my sophomore year of college.  I was in training for a summer of being a Christian camp counselor, with a staff of people who were all from Christian colleges (and I wasn't).</p>

        <p>And I felt like they were all hypocrites (this was judgmental of me). I felt like - "wow, you go to a Christian school and learn all this Christian stuff but have barely moved past the basics" (this was me feeling self-righteous). What's more - at this very camp in the seventh grade was where I first concretely made a commitment to follow Jesus. And now here I was disappointed and worried at the kinds of leaders that these children's spiritual explorations were being directed by! (Of course, by the end of the summer I gained a deep respect for my fellow counselors and their giftings and the mighty ways God used them to affect the lives of campers.)</p>

        <p>I thought it so much more imperative that I needed to be "spiritually better", so that I might not "be like them". I really wanted to not mislead or miss out on opportunities to share the Gospel that had so changed me when I was at camp. (What a strange mix of motives!)</p>

        <p>And I had only heard of one main method to be spiritually empowered to be such a person as I aspired to be that summer.</p>

        <p>Something I had thought unexciting, dull and routine. Something I had tried but had always seemed a chore. Something I dreaded doing for reasons I know not and had never seriously sought before.</p>

        <p>Something called prayer.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="quote-looking">But of course [God] will not meantime be idle. Whenever there is prayer, there is danger of His own immediate action. He is cynically indifferent to the dignity of His position, and ours [being demons], as pure spirits, and to human animals on their knees He pours out self-knowledge in a quite shameless fashion.</p>

        <p class="quote-looking">Once all [a person's] thoughts and images have been flung aside or, if retained, retained with a full recognition of their merely subjective nature, and the man trusts himself to the completely real, external, invisible Presence, there with him in the room and never knowable by him as he is known by it - why, then it is that the incalculable may occur.</p>

        <h2>A Holy Isolation</h2>

        <p>I want to emphasize the isolation (however unjustified) I felt at the beginning of camp that summer because that's what allowed me to not want to stay up in the evenings with the others socializing.  It freed me (uncomfortably) to just go to bed and have some time in the morning with God instead.</p>

        <p>And I started simple - praying that he'd use me, praying that he'd inspire me with the children, and praying that he'd lead me to even be friends with the other counselors (in time, I started praying for them too). I read a book, <i>Cost of Discipleship</i>, and would talk to God as I read it. Sometimes I just gazed out upon the water. Or I'd close my eyes, feel the breeze and gently talk with God through my feelings, desires, hopes, and just praying over the people I would interact with that day.</p>

        <p>Thus I began to sense in these times of really trying to just pray and talk with God on my own in a quiet place...that something powerful was happening.</p>

        <p>The words that I had been reading for years in the Bible and in Christian books started to make it from my head to my heart. I understood in a new way love, joy, and peace and in a new way my own brokenness and how I daily wrong God and others.</p>

        <p>And I had prayed before, but now it was different. Now I was going down by the lakeside to seek after a deeper reality that had always been there. A person that had always been there, waiting for me.</p>

        <p>This is where a whole new aspect of friendship kicked in.</p>

        <p>When I started spending quality time with God.</p>

        <p>When God and I started talking like friends.</p>

        <h2>A Conversation That Transcends Language</h2>

        <p>This initial getting into prayer to me felt like when you've seen or heard about someone for a while and you think they might be cool, but you've never actually talked to them, and you finally go talk to them and you're sad that you waited so long because they're <i>really</i> cool, and you realize they wanted to talk to you too!  It's exciting.  And with God you can even skip all the icebreakers and small talk because he already knows everything about you.</p>

        <p>You might say - "Well, that sounds cool - but if God's so great to talk to, why don't I ever hear him talk back?"</p>

        <p>This is why many of us give up very early.  Because when you go to talk to the person you've only seen or heard about, suppose they speak a different language.  Well, not even that.  Suppose they <i>transcend</i> language.  I guess my metaphor breaks down here.</p>

        <p>What I mean to say is I started realizing talking to God is one thing.  But listening is a whole other skill.  When I slowly started to practice and learn about this skill - even with a heavy dose of skepticism! - I began to comprehend, slowly but surely, how a human being can hear the Voice of God.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="quote-looking">God has many things to say to us. He has many thoughts to put into our minds. We are apt to be so busy doing His work that we do not stop to listen to His Word.</p>

        <p class="quote-looking">It is good to be conscious that we are always in the presence of God. It is better to gaze upon Him in adoration. But it is best of all to commune with Him as a Friend - and that is prayer.</p>

        <h2>Getting In Close</h2>

        <p>That summer I began to learn to listen to God through a diverse set of ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>notable opportunities that come to mind when praying</li>
          <li>people and their needs that are brought to mind when praying</li>
          <li>words of the Bible coming alive in prayer</li>
          <li>words of Christian books, music, or fellow brothers and sisters resonating powerfully with present events and providing peace, joy, or confidence at just the right time</li>
          <li>my chaotic emotions being stilled when I just consciously drew near to Him in the middle of the day</li>
          <li>the wind rushing around me just after lifting up a request in prayer, in a felt confirmation of His presence</li>
          <li>small miracles (at least to me) like weeds being replaced a few weeks later by flowers in the spot where I went to pray</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And I realized talking to God is one thing (and a necessary beginning point), but talking <i>with</i> God requires that we learn how to listen to a voice unlike any other in our lives, beyond translation or explanation.</p>

        <p>And sitting by myself, in a holy isolation, by the lake in those early mornings of summer camp, I rediscovered the God I had met in the seventh grade in a whole new way, through this mysterious act called prayer.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="quote-looking">Prayer then is simply a form of waking up out of the dull sleep in which our life has been spent in half-intentions, half-resolutions, half-creations, half-loyalties, and a becoming actively aware of the real character of that which we are and of that which we are over against. It is an opening of drowsy lids. It is a shaking off of grave-clothes. It is a dip into acid. It is a daring to "read the text of the universe in the original."</p>

        <h2>The Most Important Thing</h2>

        <p>I never realized until the writing of this blog post series how strange my initial motivations were for entering the spiritual disciplines and beginning to know God: basically wanting to not be a hypocrite, and being judgmental of the hypocrites I saw around me.</p>

        <p>Which, perhaps unpredictably, introduced me to a relationship with the only One who has never been, is never, and will never be a hypocrite.  The guy whose nametag is literally: "I am that I am."</p>

        <p>Did you know: research shows the highest motivating factor for us isn't money, fear of punishment, or any sort of external reward.  It's <i>wanting to be like someone</i>. </p>

        <p>And now, this someone that I began to get to know like a friend also began to supply me with the right motivations.  I no longer followed the rules for reward or to avoid punishment.  I began to follow his ways because I wanted to be like Him.</p>

        <p>I realized through this relationship that there's nothing more important than knowing God.  From there, everything else follows.</p>

        <p>The Bible wasn't anymore just wise words and a good way to live life - it was like a textbook turned into a personal letter. </p>

        <p>And prayer wasn't anymore just a time to ask God for favors - it was time I treasured with my God, my Father, my friend.</p> 

        <hr>

        <p class="quote-looking">The truth of the matter is, we all come to prayer with a tangled mass of motives - altruistic and selfish, merciful and hateful, loving and bitter. Frankly, this side of eternity we will never unravel the good from the bad, the pure from the impure. But what I have come to see is that God is big enough to receive us with all our mixture. We do not have to be bright, or pure, or filled with faith, or anything. That is what grace means, and not only are we saved by grace, we live by it as well. And we pray by it.</p>

        <!--<p class="quote-looking">God listens me into silence, into humiliation, into humility, until at last I come into some faint splash of the deep sanity that recalls me to what I am on earth for.</p>

        <p class="small-font">James Emory White, The Prayer God Longs For</p>

        <p class="quote-looking" style="margin:0.5em 0 0.25em 0">The word "prayer" really means "a wish directed towards," that is, towards God. All that true prayer seeks is God Himself, for with Him we get all we need. Prayer is simply "the turning of the soul to God."</p>

        <h2>A Beginner</h2>

        <p>I don't want you to leave this post thinking that I am this hyper-disciplined or super spiritual person.  (I started praying because I was judgmental, remember!)  I want you to leave this post thinking that this might just be what you were made for.</p>

        <p>God is always speaking.  God has spoken.  God wants to know you.  The Creator of the universe.  The Creator of you.  It's a relationship, a friendship, worth pursuing more than anything else.  From it everything else in my life draws power, purpose, strength, and meaning.  Through this relationship I can truly be free to love, rejoice, serve, and live a fuller life than I ever imagined before.</p>

        <p>I pray that this written-down beginning of my story in getting to know God can perhaps spark the beginning or the deepening of your relationship with Him.  An <i>eternal</i> relationship.  The best friend you can have, forever.</p>

        <p>Funny enough, at the end of the summer, my head counselor wrote me a letter that said, "You are the most disciplined person I have ever met."</p>

        <p>Thankfully I had grown past that initial pride and self-righteousness and thought upon reading it:</p>

        <p>"No, I'm merely a beginner."</p>
