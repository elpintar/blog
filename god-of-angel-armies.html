        <p class="small-column">I know sign language because I was born with 80-90 dB profound hearing loss. It came out of nowhere in my all-hearing family, and my mom prayed that one day I would be able to overcome my disability and be able to support myself with a job. 21 years later, even me having the opportunity to be at a world-class college, full of opportunities is a testament to God's awesome power and listening ears to hear our cries.</p>

        <p class="small-column">Growing up, I never felt comfortable using sign language and was embarrassed to sign around hearing folks, even to my interpreter in school. I also remember wanting to use my sign language during Church songs, but always feared doing that too.</p>

        <p class="small-column">A few years ago, at a powerful Christian conference called Passion, I first began to praise God through sign language in this very song, &quot;Whom Shall I Fear?&quot;</p>

        <p class="small-column">Ever since I let go of that fear, it has returned manifold blessings. One of which being this little joy of a sign language class that I get to teach, which in turn has brought joy to others.</p>

        <p class="small-column">And I think God works like this for everyone. When we realize the only way to overcome our fear is to surrender to Him, we let the God who created us come by our side, guiding us, protecting us, bringing Light to our lives and shining into the lives of those around us.</p>

        <p class="small-column">&quot;I know who goes before me...&quot; Looking back, time and time again I realize how God has always been forging the path ahead.</p>

        <p class="small-column">&quot;I know who stands behind...&quot; The more I let go of my own goals and wants, the more I see the things He has been preparing me for all my life, and I'm blown away every time.</p>

        <p class="small-column">&quot;Whom shall I fear?&quot; Nothing compares to the freedom we can have in Jesus.</p>

        <p class="small-column">May this video bless you.</p>
