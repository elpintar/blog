        <h2>The Decision</h2>

        <p>It started with a decision to read the Bible every day.</p>

        <p>What it took was my friends in sophomore year of high school saying to me, "Do you really believe all that wack stuff in the Old Testament?"</p>

        <p>I said, "Yeah."</p>

        <p>Inside I thought, <i>but I definitely haven't read it all...</i></p>

        <p>And out of sheer distaste at my own hypocrisy, I started reading the Bible straight through, starting with the Old Testament, so I could at least have read once through the thing in which I said I believed. </p>

             the people are waiting

        <h2>A Minimum</h2>

        <p>I set for myself a minimum: every night, I wouldn't let my head hit the pillow until I had read <i>at least</i> one small column of text in my little travel-sized Bible, which took about two to three minutes.</p>

        <p>More often then not, I didn't feel like doing it. But doing <i>at least</i> one column wasn't so hard and didn't take too long.</p>

        <p>I think this is profoundly important.  Not setting the goal so high.  Not thinking our life and discipline will change overnight, but through a small, simple step forward.</p>

        <p>Some days the words really spoke to me profoundly, and I dived in, reading several pages, or dwelling deep upon one sentence for several minutes.  Most days they weren't earth-shattering, sometimes not even interesting to me at all, but it always felt good afterwards to have done it.  At the very least, I was becoming less of a hypocrite Bible-believer each night, right?</p>

        <p>But it was more than that. There were moments the words would deeply encourage me when things were dark. Convict me of wrong that I had done. Spur me on to good actions that would bless others. They were more than useful. The words would begin to change things about me, at the fundamental level.</p>

        <p class="quote-looking">All Scripture is breathed out by God and useful for showing us truth, exposing our rebellion, correcting our mistakes, and training us to live God's way. Through the Word we are put together and shaped up for the tasks God has for us.</p>

        <h2>The Part Where I Misunderstand Things</h2>

        <p>Having that one discipline I felt like a pretty good Christian. Most Christians don't even read the Bible everyday, and I did, so I was better than most Christians. </p>

        <p>What awful thinking!</p>

        <p>After all I didn't even start reading the bible to become a disciplined follower of God, or of God's Word.  I merely started because I did not want to be a hypocrite who didn't even read the book in which he professed belief.  In fact, I didn't even really know what I believed until I read the Bible.</p>

        <p>Reading the Bible for myself, I realized I had misunderstood Christianity.  I had thought I was following a religion, a system, a list of things to live by.  I had heard many times that it's all about your relationship with God, but I thought that relationship still meant just adopting certain habits and believing certain creeds and being all set for heaven, but this side of heaven we couln't <i>really</i> get to know God like a friend.</p>

        <p>I had been assuming a relationship with God was nothing like a real relationship with a person, but figured that some really holy people got special revelations and for the rest of us, we'd have to be content with secondhand information.</p>

        <p>But when people confronted my beliefs, like my friends who doubted the validity of the Old Testament, I was thrown into internal turmoil and doubted my whole system.  I was easily shaken by any variety of teaching around me, by any rushing wind of contradiction or skepticism.</p>

        <p>The reality was my faith was not yet truly my own because of this key flaw: my very faith was secondhand.  It had been given to me - by pastors, by parents, by Sunday School teachers.  I was standing on the words of others and not on the trust of my own relationship with God.</p>

        <p>But it was slowly becoming revealed to me that this was no private nightly reading session - it was me and the living words of God.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="quote-looking">For it is not mere words that nourish the soul, but God Himself, and unless and until the hearers find God in personal experience they are not the better for having heard the truth. The Bible is not an end in itself, but a means to bring men to an intimate and satisfying knowledge of God, that they may enter into Him, that they may delight in His Presence, may taste and know the inner sweetness of the very God Himself in the core and center of their hearts.</p>

        <h2>The Part Where The Pages Unfold</h2>

        <p>That's where I got lucky - this book in which I had professed faith is truly like no other.  Most books speak to your mind, or speak to stir your emotions.  But the Bible cuts straight to the heart.  To the core of our being.  It's unavoidably personal.  It is as if God is speaking right to you and the words are themselves alive.</p>

        <p>If you are thinking at this point, "Surely reading this old book cannot be that powerful..." - think again.</p>

        <p>In fact, what other medium than the written word could be as powerful in this way? Reading can bring images and visions that no film or painting could capture. Reading allows thoughts and extrapolations at entirely your own pace. A book allows reliability across peoples and generations like a conversation or experience never could. And this book does all of those things to the full. It is a book I will never stop reading for it will never stop revealing. Revealing things to me that bring joy and life and hope beyond anything I could've ever imagined - over, and over, and over again.</p>

        <p>I think this is part of why God most consistently or initially reveals himself to people through what seems a mere set of papers with ink patterns on the pages. Even though reading an old book may not seem like the exciting beginning to the most important adventure, relationship, friendship of your life...it was this for me.</p>

        <p>I mean, the Bible's really a pretty good and important book as it is, worth reading merely for cultural and historical understanding.  But it doesn't end there.  The book is after all, just a medium for <i>Him</i>.</p>

        <p class="small-font close-in">Psalm 33</p>

        <p class="quote-looking">And this word of God which brought all worlds into being cannot be understood to mean the Bible, for it is not a written or printed word at all, but the expression of the will of God spoken into the structure of all things.  This word of God is the breath of God filling the world with living potentiality. The Voice of God is the most powerful force in nature, indeed the only force in nature, for all energy is here only because the power-filled Word is being spoken.</p>

        <p class="quote-looking close-in">God's word in the Bible can have power only because it corresponds to God's word in the universe.</p>

        <h2>The End And The Beginning</h2>

        <p>And then one of those days, my senior year of high school, I was on the last page of the 1000-something pages and realized how far I had come by those simple small portions of time.  That little bible that had previously been untouched was now falling apart at the seams and filled up with green, blue, and red (interesting, important, and Spirit-speaking) underlines.  Just through a minimum of two to three minutes before bed.</p>

        <p>Today, almost eight years later, I still do this (currently on my third time through!). This was the first spiritual discipline I entered into, by the grace of God.</p>

        <p>And just from reading God's Words seriously and consistently for the first time, my heart and life began to change.  I slowly realized what the story was really about.  The big picture started to come into focus.</p>

        <p>The Bible is about a God who created a people made for himself, a people that turned away from Him.</p>
        <p>The Bible is about a God who provides a way back to Himself through his promised Son.</p>
        <p>The Bible is about a God who desires a relationship with us.</p>

        <p>And I realized - I had only thus far ventured to know <i>about</i> God, not to actually <i>know</i> Him.  This was the beginning of going from a religion to a relationship.  This was the beginning of understanding who God is and entering into my part to play in His story.</p>

        <p>This was the beginning of getting to know God like a friend.</p>
